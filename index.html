									<h2>Maple Electronics</h2>
									<h4><b>Intern</b></h4>
									<h5>June 2020 - Present</h5>
									<p>As an intern I joined a team of web-developers who were assigned with redesigning and developing a website for a local electronic component seller, Maple Electronics. Within this project we were given with two tasks. Redesigning the front-end, as well as creating a back-end and database. During phase 1 (front-end) we utilized HTML5 and CSS3, and succesfully redesigned the frontend. Currently we are working on phase 2 (creating a back-end), applying technologies such as node.JS and SQL.<br><a href="https://mapleelectronics.com" target="_blank">MapleElectronics.com</a></p>

									<h4><b>Co-Founder</b></h4>
									<h5>April 2020 - Present</h5>
									<p>In April of 2020, as the Corona-Virus pandemic was becoming a global crisis, I co-founded Community Connector. As a non-profit community outreach organization, we continue to fulfill our mission of providing assistance to the local community; as an ongoing effort to be part of the Covid-19 relief community. Besides from heading operations, part of my work here also entails marketing. More specifically graphic design; namely logo design and flyer creation.<br><a href="https://www.comconnector.org" target="_blank">ComConnector.org</a></p>

									<h2>NexAgility</h2>
									<h4><b>Marketing Manager and Webmaster</b></h4>
									<h5>February 2020 - Present</h5>
									<p> During my time with NexAgility, I was given the oppurtunity to gain experience as their webmaster and marketing manager. As their Webmaster I created a website on Weebly and currently manage it. Another task I was given was to take on the role of their marketing manager. While being the marketing manager I created multiple flyers for them and designed their logo. The last past of my role, with NexAgility, entails me to assist them in setting up their trainings and workshops.<br>
